            <p class="d1">In Greek Mythology, Poseidon is the ruler of the seas. He one of the sons of the Titan, Cronus, and a brother of Zeus. He is known for having a bad temper, and often when he doesn't get his way, he lashes out.</p>
            <p class="d2">He is not only the ruler of the seas, but also the god of earthquakes and horses</p>
            <p class="d3">One famous story of Poseidon is when he and Athena compete for patronage of Athens. Poseidon gives a saltwater spring, while Athena gives an olive tree. When the people choose Athena, he tries to flood the city.</p>
