            <p class="f1">In the anime, One Piece, Shirahoshi has the power to rule the seas. She is mermaid royalty who has the rare genetic power to command the Sea Kings. This power is referred to as the Power of Poseidon.</p>
            <p class="f2">Besides this power, she is basically a normal mortal mermaid, not being the goddess or being associated with horses, earthquakes, etc.</p>
            <p class="f3">The background picture of this page is when Shirahoshi accidentially summoned the Sea Kings when her mother was being threatened.</p>
